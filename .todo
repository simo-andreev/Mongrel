## Format defined as per https://github.com/matthewpalmer/.todo
## TODOs for the whole project in general -i.e. features, refactor and version goals etc ##

## Chores:
- []  Unit tests
- []  Any other tests?
- []  README.md

## Patch goals:
- [x] Documentation

## Minor-v goals:
- []  Add an annotation super-class to @ExposedModel - @PersistedModel - that only stores
        (and I guess provides an internal CRUD API) - i.e. does not add @RestController to the Repo//Api class
+ []  Add an optional - mappedBy : KClass//Class - parameter to @ExposedModel that lets user provide CrudApi sub-class
        implementing custom persistence and exposure logic

## Major-v goals:
- []  Implement (optional) security and authentication
- []  Add script that launches the MongoDB instance at project-run, if it is missing.
