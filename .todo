## Format based on https://github.com/matthewpalmer/.todo
## * With some added spice:
##      - `~` box-mark - marks a `To` that is being actively 'Do'-ed
##      - `-` line prefix - defines a MUST-do to-do
##      - `+` line prefix - defines a MIGHT-do to-do
##      - `##` line prefix - defines a section and should contain a title sting
## --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------##
## TODOs for the whole project in general -i.e. features, refactor and version goals etc ##

## Chores:
- []  Documentation (Review, now that it has sat for 3 years and I can view it as essentially sth written by another person)
- []  Integration tests? Yes? No? Maybe?
- []  README.md
- []  GaF v.002 - detailed function description
- []  CI/CD (Check what GitHub offers nowadays?)
- []  Issue tracker (JB Hub/YouTrack/Space/etc and are nice and all, but GitHub Issues will prolly be easier and I just need it so I can play-pretend that I'm doing sth of value here and not just faffing-about in IntelliJ :I )

## Patch goals:
- []  Unit tests
- []  Add up-to-date dokka configs

## Minor-v goals:
- [x] Add an annotation super-class to @ExposedModel - @PersistedModel - that only stores
        (and I guess provides an internal CRUD API) - i.e. does not add @RestController to the Repo//Api class
+ []  Add an optional - mappedBy : KClass//Class - parameter to @ExposedModel that lets user provide CrudApi sub-class
        implementing custom persistence and exposure logic (GaF#3)

## Major-v goals:
- []  Implement (optional) security and authentication (GaF#6)
+ []  Implement (optional) security and authentication per-model/action combo (GaF#6)
- []  Implement (optional) business logic layer in CRUD (GaF#2)
- []  Implement (optional) business logic layer in REST (GaF#3)
- []  Implement Model versioning and Migration support (GaF#5)
- []  Allow external Mongo instance (GaF#4)
- []  Allow auto-propping internal Mongo instance (GaF#4)
- []  Update deployment shit
+ []  Update package name to simo-andreev.dev?
